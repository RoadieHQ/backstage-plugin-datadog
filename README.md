## Setup and integrate the plugin into Backstage.

1. In the [packages/app](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/packages/app/) directory of your backstage instance, add the plugin as a package.json dependency:

```shell
$ yarn add @roadiehq/backstage-plugin-datadog
```

2. import the plugin to the [entityPage.tsx](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/packages/app/src/components/catalog/EntityPage.tsx) source file:

```tsx
import {
  EntityDatadogContent,
  EntityDatadogGraphCard,
  isDatadogGraphAvailable
} from '@roadiehq/backstage-plugin-datadog';
```

4. Add a Datadog card to the overview tab to the [entityPage.tsx](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/packages/app/src/components/catalog/EntityPage.tsx) source file:

```tsx
const overviewContent = (
  <Grid container spacing={3} alignItems="stretch">
    ...
    <EntitySwitch>
      <EntitySwitch.Case if={isDatadogGraphAvailable}>
        <Grid item>
         <EntityDatadogGraphCard/>
        </Grid>
      </EntitySwitch.Case>
    </EntitySwitch>
    ...
  </Grid>
);
```

5. Add a Datadog tab to the [entityPage.tsx](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/packages/app/src/components/catalog/EntityPage.tsx) source file:

```tsx
const serviceEntityPage = (
  <EntityPageLayout>
    ...
  <EntityLayout.Route path="/datadog" title="Datadog">
    <EntityDatadogContent />
  </EntityLayout.Route>
    ...
  </EntityPageLayout>
)
```
## Specify datadog domain

Datadog embedded graph is using `datadoghq.eu`as default top-level domain, when other is not specified. If you are using other domain, you need to specify it with corresponding annotations `datadoghq.com/site`.

### Adding the annotations and the values from Datadog to your component's metadata file.

```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: sample-service
  description: |
    A sample service
  annotations:
    datadoghq.com/site: <<DATADOGDOMAIN>>
```

## Embed a datadog dashboard in Backstage

* Select a dashboard from this list.

![dashboard](./docs/dd-dashboard.png?raw=true)


* Copy the URL from the Sharing textbox.

* This URL is the value you need for the `datadoghq.com/dashboard-url` annotation.

![dashboard share](./docs/dd-dashboard-share.png?raw=true)


### Adding the annotations and the values from Datadog to your component's metadata file.

### Customize graph size.

* In order to customize size of the graph you may specify `datadoghq.com/graph-size` annotations and specify one of the following options: 

* 'small'
* 'medium'
* 'large'
* 'x-large';

If not specified, your graph will be 'medium' size per default.

## Security

A word of note regarding the security of the datadog dashboards and graphs.

The instructions provided for sharing dashboards and graphs generate a URL.

This URL is public to anyone who bears it.

If obtained by another actor, it is usable by them.
